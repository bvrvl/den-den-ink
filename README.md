# Den Den Ink üêå

Den Den Ink is a fast, simple, and thematic command-line tool for taking notes, inspired by the loyal communication snails of *One Piece*. It's built in C++ for performance and uses SQLite for robust, local storage.

## Features

-   **General & Programming Notes**: Supports standard notes and specialized notes for developers that automatically capture context like the current directory and Git branch.
-   **Flexible Tagging**: Add `#tags` anywhere in your note‚Äîbefore, after, or even inside the text.
-   **Powerful Search**: Quickly find notes by text and tags.
-   **Quick Listing**: List recent notes or filter by a specific tag.
-   **Insightful Stats**: Get an overview of your note-taking habits, including top tags and project activity.
-   **Thematic Flair**: Fun, snail-themed confirmations and icons.

## Installation

You can install Den Den Ink by building it from the source.

**On Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev build-essential
```

###Build from Source
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bvrvl/den-den-ink.git
cd den-den-ink
```

2. Compile the application
```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 -o ink main.cpp database.cpp metadata_collector.cpp note_formatter.cpp stats_engine.cpp -lsqlite3

3. Make it globally accesible:
```bash
sudo mv ink /usr/local/bin/
